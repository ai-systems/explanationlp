# ExplanationLP: Abductive reasoning for Science QA

To do:
- [x] Integrate Generics KB
- [ ] Speedup the LP process
- [ ] WordNet Grounding
- [ ] Grounding goes updwards (Impose montonocity)
- [x] Move towards ARC Corpus
- [ ] IR based on embeddings (Move away from lexical overlap)
- [ ] Similar Questions have similar explanations constraint
- [ ] Relevance from the grouding fact
- [ ] Extend the hops
- [ ] Better scoring function (Introduce Graph Networks with BERT)
- [ ] Semantic Abstractions to calculate overlap
- [ ] Relevance and overlap score from pre trained neural approaches
- [ ] Overlap approaches that take the chains into account

EMNLP Rebuttal To Do:
- [ ] multiprocessing linear programming
- [ ] Try BoTorch
- [x] Classify grounding facts 
- [ ] Impose monotonicity
- [ ] Reduce redundant facts
- [ ] Sepearate extractions for abstract and grounding
- [ ] Use GenericsKB facts score
- [ ] Run for the fullest on ARC corpus

AAI To Do:
- [ ] multiprocessing linear programming
- [ ] Learning essential terms
- [ ] Classify grounding terms
- [ ] Relevance from grounding (Grounding goes updwards)
- [ ] Similar question similar explanations
- [ ] Replace BM25 with Embeddings
